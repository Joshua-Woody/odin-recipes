    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Flavorful cookies that crumble into your mouth, combined with the sweetness of peanut butter and chocalate.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon milk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla</li>
        <li>45 chocalate kiss candies</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Set the oven rack to the center position. Preheat the oven to 375Â°F</li>
        <li>Line baking sheets with parchment paper. If you are using only one cookie sheet, all the sheet to cool between batches.</li>
        <li>Sift together flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk it together to combine it.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, cream together butter, peanut butter, granulated sugar, and light brown sugar on medium, for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add egg, milk, and vanill, then mix on medium speed until well blended, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Gradually add flour mixture, mixing until combined on low speed, about 1 minute. If the dough is very soft, refrigerate for 30 minutes before rolling.</li>
        <li>Measure out 1 leveled tablespoon of cookie dough, then roll dough into approximately 1-inch sized balls.</li>
        <li>Roll cookies in sugar and place 2 inches apart on the baking sheet. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until lightly browned, puffed, with some cracks on the surface.</li>
        <li>Immediately after, firmly press chocalate into the center of each cookie. The cookie will crack more around the edges.</li>
        <li>Cool for 2 minutes on the sheet pan, then tranfer to a cooling rack.</li>
    </ol>
